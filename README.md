## Instructions:

The code for the CNN implementation is in Code/. The Binaries associated with that implementation are in Binaries/. The Kan implementation (inlcuding both C and python code) is in KANCode/. The data for both is in Data/. Each programming repo should have a more specific README with instructions

All the writing I did for this REU is inside Writing/. Miscellaneous scripts I used are in scripts/. Work related to the driver, including hardware design and driver code, are in driver/

There is also a Documentation directory for documentation not associated with a specific programming project. This includes important documentation on our fabric design, board setup, and driver development.

IMPORTANT: All documentation should be read in its entirety before following the instructions. You might find something later on that is relevant to earlier instructions.
