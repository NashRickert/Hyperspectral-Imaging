## Instructions:

The code for the CNN implementation is in Code/. The Binaries associated with that implementation are in Binaries/. The Kan implementation (inlcuding both C and python code) is in KANCode/. The data for both is in Data/. There are also some repositories for writing related to the REU. Each programming repo should have a more specific README with instructions

There is also a Documentation directory for documentation not associated with a specific programming project. This will contain stuff such as relevant board/linux instructions and instructions on the hardware design that we used to test our driver.

Venv requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file for running python code
